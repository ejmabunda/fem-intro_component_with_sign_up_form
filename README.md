## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Constraint Validation API

### What I learned

This challenge uses custom form validation which is a topic I haven't dived in, so I had to learn how to use the Constraint Validation API to complete this challenge.

### Continued development

The JS might be a bit messy, but it will be updated to prioritize efficiency as I learn more about the API and the JavaScript language itself.

### Useful resources

- [Client-side form validation (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation) - This is where I learned about the Constraint Validation API, which enabled more control over the validation, and the look and feel.
